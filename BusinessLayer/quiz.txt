1.What code smells did you see?
You can't reuse parts of the code. The code is hard to understand

2.What problems do you think the Speaker class has?
All functionality resides in a single class. The "Register" method is loaded and tightly coupled, leading to maintenance difficulties.

3.Which clean code principles (or general programming principles) did it violate?
Both SOLID principles and KISS principles were violated, because the code was not simple enough to understand.
This happens because a class contained all the checks in one method, and if I wanted to add a new "Login" method " I should have duplicated the code.

4.What refactoring techniques did you use?
Split the 'Register' method into smaller, more manageable methods.
Moved exceptions to a separate folder for better organization and clarity. 
Implemented try-catch blocks around each method.
